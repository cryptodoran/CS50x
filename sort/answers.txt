sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: We saw during the lecture that, in the case of a large list of randomized inputs (numbers), bubble sort took signifcantly longer than both Selection and Merge. Running Sort1 on random50000.txt proved this theory.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: Sort 2 completed 'reversed50000.txt' the fastest. With that large of a dataset, finishing the fastest of the 3 must mean Sort 2 is using the merge sort algorithm.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: While faster than Sort1 on random50000.txt, Selection (or sort3), was slower to sort than 'Sort2'
