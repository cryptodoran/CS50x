Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The amount of time to run the simulation doesn't seem to increase linearly with the number of N.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would use 10,000 and call that 'good enough'.
