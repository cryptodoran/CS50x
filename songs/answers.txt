I would characterize a listeners audio aura from their top 100 songs in 2018 by calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of said songs and formulating that into a discernable value that could be used within a program.

The audio aura, when calculated this way, might not be very representative or indicative of the listener because when taking such a "broad stroke" as the above does, your calculation might result in several songs that look similar, on paper, to what the listener likes - but might in fact be songs the listener would never listen to. For example, some EDM songs might resemble some Hip Hop songs when utilizing the previously stated parameters.
