              <p>The Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History's Lepidoptera division's department of entomology collections is the first place you detect a faint, vaguely recognizable smell. Mothballs. Before going to Bob Robbins, a research entomologist, I briefly considered the cosmic irony of mothballs in a room full of moths (and butterflies, a lineage of moths designed to fly during the day). He said that since many insects can consume dried insects, naphthalene or mothballs were traditionally used to keep off pests.


              </p>
              
              
              
           
              <p>The use of mothballs has been phased out (in favor of freezing fresh specimens to destroy any pests), but the lingering scent and the endless drawers of insects properly arranged in rows of steel cabinets for taxonomic posterity only add to the impression of antiquity in the quiet room. As the millions of specimens appear to be motionless, so does time.</p>
              <p>However, as you rummage through those drawers and the neatly positioned squadrons of swallowtails and sunset moths, a new concept starts to emerge: this is not a dormant storehouse, but rather a laboratory that examines an incredibly successful endeavor. These "products" have undergone over 150 million years of relentless prototyping, market testing, upgrading, refining, and other new and improved processes as the environment evolved. Each of these delicate specimens has an innovative package that is just waiting to be understood and applied.</p>
              <p>The idea behind the growingly popular field of biomimicry is that since we humans have only recently begun to try to create things, we can learn a lot from the long processes of natural selection, whether it be how to make a wing more aerodynamic, a city more resilient, or an electronic display more colorful. An MIT alumnus called Mark Miles started experimenting with micro-electromechanical systems and materials processing more than ten years ago.
                He was stopped in his tracks as he turned the pages of a scientific magazine by an article about how butterflies produce color in their wings. Those wings harbor a nanoscale assemblage of shingled plates, whose shape and distance from one another are arranged in a precise pattern that disrupts reflective light wavelengths to produce the brilliant blue. For example, the brilliant iridescent blue of the various Morpho species comes not from pigment but from "structural color." It would take a lot more energy—energy that would be better spent on flying, eating, and reproducing—to make the same blue out of pigment.
              </p>
              <p> If this skill might be used in some manner, Miles pondered. Where else may you need a tiny container with such vibrant color? Of course: on a screen of an electronic gadget. Qualcomm adopted the technique in their Mirasol display after acquiring the business Miles founded to create it. According to Qualcomm's Brian Gally, senior director of product management, "we take use of the optical interference phenomenon." A massive number of interferometric modulators, which are essentially tiny (10 to 50 micron square) mirrors that move up and down in microseconds to produce the desired hue, are hidden beneath the glass surface.</p>
              <p>According to Gally, "the display is taking the white ambient light around us, white light or sunshine, and via interference is going to feed us back a color image." This is similar to how the butterfly's wings work. The Mirasol doesn't need to produce its own light, in contrast to traditional LCD panels. The Mirasol uses a tenth of the power of an LCD reader because "the display brightness merely naturally adjusts with ambient light." The display was utilized by Qualcomm in an e-reader and is now available for license to other businesses.</p>
              <p>Even though biomimicry has long served as a source of inspiration for human inventions—one of the most famous examples being Velcro, which Swiss engineer Georges de Mestral invented in 1955 after observing how burs adhered to his clothes—better technology and more in-depth research have made it possible for humans to make ever-more complex adaptations. The distribution of strength and loads in trees and bones is reflected in the design software developed by German researcher Claus Mattheck and utilized in Opel and Mercedes automobiles.
                To circulate air more effectively, a fan developed by Pax Scientific mimics the patterns of spinning kelp, nautilus, and whelks. Condensation and evaporation techniques learned from a camel's nose will be applied in a saltwater-irrigated greenhouse in the Qatari desert. As a result of recent advancements in nanoscale manufacturing, producers are now releasing a wider range of goods on the market.
              </p>
              <p>Biomimicry is a method that draws inspiration from natural processes and creatures rather than being an end in itself. Ecosystems may serve as a source of inspiration for businesses and even cities, according to scientist Tim McGee, a member of the Montana-based consultancy Biomimicry 3.8. The developers of Lavasa, which they refer to as "India's first planned hill metropolis," expect to eventually build there more than 300,000 dwellings, conferred with landscape architects.
                Deciduous trees were therefore planted as part of the planting strategy to create a canopy that would collect and then reflect through evaporation almost a third of the monsoon rain that fell on it. According to McGee, this impact "works like an engine that pulls the monsoon inland," preventing dryness there. The design of a better water-dispatching roof shingle was influenced by the hydrodynamically effective form of banyan tree leaves, and water divert systems were motivated by the methods harvester ants divert water away from their nests. Four additional Lavasa "towns" are expected to be finished by the year 2020 after the first one.
              </p>
              <p>Everyone is discussing how to leave a smaller carbon footprint or achieve "net zero" effect. What if we could create our cities in a similar way? According to McGee, nature often goes one step further: "It's nearly never net zero—the output from that system is usually positive to everything around it." What if the water that entered the East River in New York City after a raindrop fell was cleaner than when it dropped? And what if fires in woods could be put out using techniques that didn't rely on poisonous substances? According to McGee, harmless flame retardants are produced by nature. What prevents us? ”</p>
              <p>Without success, scientists have been studying the chemistry of flame retardants for years. However, McGee speculates that possibly natural processes could provide a route for creativity in the lab. Perhaps it has something to do with the way jack-pine cones expand in hot weather (to allow reproduction even while fire decimates the forest), or how eucalyptus trees expel shards of quickly burning bark to draw oxygen and divert fire from the main trunk.
                Chitosan, a renewable material derived from lobster and shrimp shells (and a chemical cousin of the chitin in butterflies' wings), is used by mechanical engineer Jaime Grunlan at Texas A&M to create a nanolayer polymer coating that, when exposed to heat, produces a carbon "shell" that shields the fabric.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lepidoptera are a good example of some of the issues that have been worked out over many eons of time on nature's drafting board. Many moths have evolved the capacity to recognize the sonar clicks of bats in the evolutionary call and response between prey and predator, and some can even emit perplexing countersignals. In order to better trap heat, butterfly wings are often blacker closer to their bodies. These wings have a contaminant-resistant coating, making them self-cleaning. The decorative "eyes" on those wings, which are supposed to frighten off predators, are frequently placed close to the edge to reduce wing damage if the butterfly is eaten.
              </p>
              <p>The color is another factor—what it's we associate with butterflies. Robbins claims that they are known as "flying flowers." While some organisms employ color to disguise themselves, the most colorful species take the opposite approach by gaudily displaying their toxicity to potential predators. In general, butterflies "represent an ideal of sweetness and gentle grace that seems almost innocent of the whole merciless evolutionary free-for-all," according to writer David Quammen, who calls them the "bimbos of the natural world." And there's a wealth of inspiration waiting to take flight on those gossamer wings.</p>
<p>Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University are developing a structurally similar super-black amorphous carbon film to aid in the development of more effective solar technology. Birdwing butterflies were the inspiration for these researchers because the black area of their wings allows almost total light absorption and traps heat. An anti-counterfeiting stamp that is more difficult to break than a hologram and can be "printed" on a variety of other things, including bank notes, is made possible by the NOtES project, which is the result of research at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.
  RFID tags, which are used for anything from tracking goods to monitoring tire performance, frequently operate poorly in harsh conditions, especially if there is metal or water. In order to increase the reliability of RFID, a firm by the name of Omni-ID modified the interference principle by incorporating microscopic metal scales in the tags.

  It makes sense that the butterfly has influenced human fashion, given that the Morpho uses color to get attention. A pigment-free, iridescent blue fabric called Morphotex was used to make three gowns by Sydney, Australia-based fashion designer Donna Sgro, who also calls herself a "occasional lepidopterist." The color of the fabric comes through optical interference.
  Despite the fact that Morphotex does away with the requirement for dyes (possibly leaving a lower environmental impact), Sgro claims that her interest went beyond the typical "problem-solution-type design approach" that biomimists often employ. After all, fashion encompasses much than just the fundamental necessity for clothing. How might the use of beauty in nature influence how we utilize it? Sgro is now doing a PhD at the Royal Institute of Fashion in Melbourne in biomimicry and fashion.

  It was like a lepidopterous love fest when Robbins and I left the Natural History Museum's collection area and headed to the neighboring Butterfly Pavilion. A woman tilted her smartphone to take a picture of a Monarch butterfly eating a flower. A Gulf Fritillary landed on a Japanese traveler's shoulder bag, prompting her to exclaim. As a Morpho peleides waved its brilliant blue wings slowly, a kid shrieked. Although it may or may not be true, we don't go to grub or ant pavilions, it's difficult to picture this event happening with any other creature.
</p>
<p>
  I enquired as to the strange allure of these creatures. He claimed, "They don't sting, they don't bite. "Most of the ones that people view are attractive. If only people knew today how beneficial all that beauty can be, I thought. "Some of them are destructive to agriculture, but they're very pleasant guys and they're a hell of a lot prettier than most other insects."
