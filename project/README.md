#### Description:

Hi, I'm Doran Mauldin. I love programming and I love biomimicry. This final project served as the basis for the debut of my biomimicry website.

The first two posts from my website make up this final project's material. To inform the reader about incredible Biomimicry examples and how human innovation is inspired by Biomimicry, I did a little study.
Since this is a passion project of mine, I began it a few weeks before I began this course.
My website is just getting started. The "coding" part will ultimately evolve, and I'll add additional articles. It's only an article site right now, but its purpose is to support me as I pursue a career in coding.

Let's talk about the user experience now. What my website is about is made crystal clear by the subtitle "Doranmauldin's BioMimicry Articles." Without visiting an "About" page, visitors may read my profile on the right side of the website. Modern website designs prioritize big graphics and concise language, which is exactly what I did for each of my new entries' indexes.

Later, we'll review each post in greater depth. There is a box on the side that says "Recent Articles," which enables the user to get directly to the post they want to see without having to scroll too far. Below that comes a section called "tags".

We are right now in the "coding" area. If you click the "coding" tag, no post has yet been made; nevertheless, you may easily get back to the index page by choosing "Return to Home".

Let us now discuss the articles. The user experience has been made simpler to navigate. I have included the sources links for "Aerodynamic Performance Of Extended Formation Flight" and "Bionics By Examples" to the article "8 Incredible Biomimicry Examples" in HTML format. The rest are pictures and text. The user may easily go back to the index page by clicking the "Return" button. Also available on all pages is "Fly me to the top."

Now let's go into the code. I chose to use the w3schools documentations because I think they will be the easiest for me to use and learn coding. Many HTML dependencies and components from Google Fonts and w3schools were used. In order to make the process of developing my website more simpler and more effective, I chose to integrate the CSS file in the HTML file. The "READ" buttons are "on-click instructions" in Javascript that direct readers to certain blog pages. For neat and organized coding, I organized the asset files into an asset folder, added comments to each code block, and made the code seem cleaner.

I made it live after submitting it to Netlify so the world can easily see my website. I achieved this by connecting my Github repository to Netlify after uploading my Visual Studio code files to Github. JavaScript and CSS may be found in any HTML file. Its homepage is "index.html". The coding blogs are going to be included in "tag.html." The blog entries were located in "1.html" and "2.html." They all contain HTML tags such as hr, img, h5, ul, li, h4, br, footer, style for CSS, head, and body. They also all contain div, header, b, h3, span, and p.

Thank you for viewing and reviewing!
