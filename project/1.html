              <p>Biomimicry improves design by taking cues from nature and natural processes and applying them to human-made objects. Nature spends millions of years devising solutions to problems via adaptation and evolution, ultimately producing some astounding breakthroughs. Inefficiency doesn't endure in nature for very long, thus human engineers and designers frequently appeal to nature for answers to contemporary issues. Here are eight exemplary biomimicry examples.</p>
              <h3 id="ref1">1. Burr = Velcro</h2>
              <img src="/assets/a1.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
              <p>A well-known example of biomimicry is Velcro. You could have worn shoes with velcro straps when you were younger, and you can count on wearing them in retirement.</p>
              <p>After removing burrs from his dog in 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral wanted to investigate more closely at how they functioned. He was inspired to develop the now-ubiquitous Velcro by the tiny hooks he discovered at the tips of the burr needles. Consider this: Velcro jumping, a sport in which participants seek to fling their bodies as high as they can on a wall, would not exist without this material.</p>
              
              <h3 id="ref2">2. Whale = Turbine</h2>
              <img src="/assets/a2.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
              <p>A very efficient form of life, whales have been swimming in the water for a very long period. They have the ability to descend to depths of several hundred feet and remain there for many hours. They consume creatures that are smaller than the human eye can see to maintain their enormous size. Their tail and incredibly effective fins let them to move with incredible efficiency.</p>
              <p>scientists from West Chester University, Duke University, and the U.S. The Naval Academy found that a whale fin's front edge bumps significantly boost its efficiency by lowering drag by 32% and raising lift by 8%. Businesses are implementing the concept in the design of airplane wings, cooling fans, wind turbine blades, and propellers.</p>
              
              <h3 id="ref3">3. Birds = Jets</h2>
                <img src="/assets/a3.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
                <p>By using the V-shape, birds have been able to increase their flying distance by more than 70%. Researchers have shown that when a flock forms the well-known V shape, one bird's wing flap causes a little updraft that elevates the bird behind it. Each bird that passes adds its own energy to the stroke, assisting the other birds in maintaining flight. They dispersed the effort by moving their order through the stack.</p>
                <p>According to a team of academics at Stanford University, using the same strategy might result in fuel savings for passenger flights. The group, under the direction of Professor Ilan Kroo, imagines scenarios in which planes from airports on the West Coast connect and fly in formation as they go to locations on the East Coast. According to Kroo and his colleagues, airplanes might consume 15% less fuel when flying in a V-shape, similar to how birds take turns flying in front.1</p>
              
                <h3 id="ref4">4. Lotus = Paint</h2>
                  <img src="/assets/a4.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
                  <p>The lotus bloom resembles the sharkskin of dry land in certain ways. The micro-rough surface of the flower naturally repels dust and debris, keeping its petals spotless. If you've ever examined a lotus leaf under a microscope, you've probably seen the sea of tiny protuberances that resemble nails and are used to ward off dust particles. A clean leaf is left behind after water has rolled over a lotus leaf and collected anything on the surface.</p>
                  <p>After four years of study, the German company Ispo created a paint with qualities that are similar to this event. The paint's micro-rough surface drives away dirt and dust, reducing the need to wash a house's exterior.</p>
              
                  <h3 id="ref5">5. Beetle = Water Collection</h2>
                    <img src="/assets/a5.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
                    <p>A good water collector is the stenocara beetle. The little black beetle can survive in the hard, arid desert because of the way its shell is constructed. The rear of the Stenocara is covered in tiny, smooth bumps that act as condensation sites for water or fog. The whole shell is coated in a slippery wax that resembles Teflon and is routed so that morning fog collected water is directed into the beetle's mouth. Its simplicity is great.</p>
                    <p>The Stenocara's shell served as the inspiration for an idea developed by MIT researchers, building on work by Andrew Parker of Oxford University. They have developed a substance that gathers water from the air more effectively than earlier ideas. An increase in efficiency might have a significant effect because nets are used in around 22 nations worldwide to capture water from the air.</p>

                    <h3 id="ref6">6. Sharkskin = Swimsuit</h2>
                      <img src="/assets/a6.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
                      <p>When Michael Phelps was the focus of the 2008 Summer Olympics, sharkskin-inspired swimsuits attracted a lot of media attention.</p>
                      <p>Shark skin is made up of numerous overlapping scales known as dermal denticles that may be seen under an electron microscope (or "little skin teeth"). The denticles feature grooves that follow the direction of water flow over their whole length. These grooves speed up the flow of water by preventing the development of eddies, or turbulent swirls of sluggish water. Additionally, the irregular form deters parasitic development like algae and barnacles.</p>
                      <p>Scientists have been able to duplicate skin denticles in both the underside of boats and bikinis, which are currently prohibited in major competitions. If cargo ships can increase their efficiency by even one percent, they will consume less bunker oil and won't need to use cleaning agents on their hulls. The method is being used by scientists to make surfaces in hospitals that inhibit the growth of bacteria since the bacteria can't adhere to the rough surface.</p>
              
                      <h3 id="ref7">7. Beaver = Wetsuit</h2>
                        <img src="/assets/a7.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
                        <p>Beavers have a thick covering of blubber on their bodies that helps keep them warm when they dive and swim in their aquatic habitats. They do, however, have another tactic up their sleeves for keeping warm. These aquatic creatures are kept warm and dry thanks to their thick hair, which traps warm air pockets between the layers.</p>
                        <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's engineers devised a rubbery, fur-like pelt that they claim may be used to construct "bioinspired materials," such as wetsuits, since they reasoned that surfers could find that same ability appealing.</p>
                        <p>Anette (Peko) Hosoi, a professor of mechanical engineering and assistant department chair at MIT, states, "We are particularly interested in wetsuits for surfing, because the athlete transfers often between air and water environments. We can build textures to match certain dive speeds and optimize the dry area of the wetsuit since we have control over the length, spacing, and arrangement of the hairs.</p>

                        <h3 id="ref8">8. Termite Den = Office building</h2>
                          <img src="/assets/a8.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
                          <p>Despite their unearthly appearance, termite caves are surprisingly cozy homes. The interior of a termite den maintains a constant temperature of 87 degrees, which is cozy (to a termite) while the outside temperature fluctuates dramatically throughout the day from lows in the 30s to highs over 100.</p>
                          <p>The cooling chimneys and tunnels of termite dens were examined by Mick Pearce, the architect of the Eastgate Center in Harare, Zimbabwe. With the 333,000 square foot Eastgate Centre, which requires 90% less energy to heat and cool than conventional structures, he put these insights into practice. The structure contains enormous chimneys that, like termite dens, naturally pull in cool nighttime air to reduce the temperature of the floor slabs. These slabs maintain the coolness throughout the day, substantially decreasing the need for additional air conditioning.</p>
